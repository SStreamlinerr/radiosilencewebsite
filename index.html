        We cover a large range of genres from grunge and punk to rock and metal, and artists such as Nirvana, Muse, Blur, and more. 
        We've also started a band night which takes place in the Drill Hall in Peebles every so often, if you are interested in playing 
        in one please get in touch via our instagram.

        So far we have written two originals: Black and Blue, and No Way, and are working on a few more.
        Unfortunately they haven't been released yet but they are played at most gigs so come along and have a listen.
